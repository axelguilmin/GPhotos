# GPhotos
I wanted to consume the Google Photos API in Swift but at the time of writing there is no framework that does it in a simple way.

So why not share my own take?

This project will gradually implement all endpoints.

- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Albums
  - [ ] list
  - [ ] get
  - [ ] create
  - [ ] addEnrichment
- [ ] Shared albums
  - [ ] list
  - [ ] join
- [ ] MediaItems
  - [ ] list
  - [ ] get
  - [ ] upload
  - [ ] search
    - [ ] with album id
    - [ ] with filters
